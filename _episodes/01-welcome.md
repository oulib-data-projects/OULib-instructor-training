## Before The Course Begins
> ## Getting to know each other
> In the chat, please type your Department, position (e.g. Graduate Student, Faculty), and your favorite strange animal. 

> ## Pronouns and Names
> 
> Using correct names and pronouns (e.g. "she/her") is important to setting a tone of respect. Learning these is hard to
> do quickly, so we recommend displaying it prominently during the workshop. 
> 
> In an online workshop, give everyone a moment to update their display name to reflect how they would like to be addressed. 
> 
> At an in-person event, we recommend supplying name tags and markers, or using plain paper to create table-displayed name placards.
> 
> Note that pronouns are personal and some participants might prefer not to share them.
> Do not force people to share their pronouns.

## Instructor Training Workshop Overview

The goal of this training is to provide you with the skills and information needed for best practices to teach your materials for the Workshop

- be familiar with and understand **how to apply research-based teaching principles**
- understand the **importance of a respectful and inclusive classroom environment**; commit to
creating such an environment; and be able to identify and implement what you've learned today about general practices to accomplish this
identify and implement the policies and general practices to accomplish this.
- **practice and develop skills** in the teaching methods explained today.

These three goals are broken down into four main themes of content:

### How Learning Works

One of our main emphases will be discussing the "best practices" of teaching. We
will be introducing you to a handful of key educational research
findings and demonstrating how they can be used to help people learn better and faster.

### Building Teaching Skill

Just like learning a new language, a musical instrument,
or a sport, teaching is a skill that requires practice and feedback.
We will have many opportunities to practice and give each other feedback throughout this workshop.

### Creating a Positive Learning Environment

One part of making this a productive experience for all of us is a
community effort to treat one another with kindness and respect. We will also be discussing and practicing teaching techniques to create a positive and welcoming environment in your classrooms, and will spend some time talking about why this is important.

## What We Leave Out

We do not discuss how to develop lessons, although we do mention some aspects of lesson design. We include this information to help you as an instructor identify the important components of lessons for high impact, inclusive teaching.

If there is a particular topic that you would like us to address, let the Trainers
know.

## What Questions Do You Have?

We hope and expect that you will have many questions during this training! Please do not
keep them to yourself. If you find something unclear, chances are good that others will have the same question, too. 
It is ok to ask even if you think you might have missed an answer already given
(e.g. during a distracted moment or a dropped connection)!
Depending on the time available, your Trainers may ask you to share your questions 
verbally, in the Etherpad, or otherwise. 

Now that we have a road map of what we are covering
we are ready to begin our training. Our goal is that by the end, you will
have acquired some new knowledge, confidence, and skills that you can
use in your teaching practice in general and teaching coding lessons.
